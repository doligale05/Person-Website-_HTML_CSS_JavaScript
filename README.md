# Person-Website-_HTML_CSS_JavaScript
Semester Project in CSC 440 Client Web under the guidance of Professor Bo Li

This was my first experience in using HTML and CSS. I have used JavaScript before, but not in this sense. This project took me all of 6 weeks (keep in mind, no prior experience). Which would have taken less time if I was free. 
Please let me know how I did and what I could do to improve the functionality and style. Or if you want to work on a project with me please contact me at the info below!
